# Lecture-Notes

AI Voice Lecture to notes converter:
Students frequently miss key points during lectures as it’s difficult to listen and write
notes simultaneously. A solution is required that can convert spoken lectures into text
using speech-to-text AI and then summarise the content into clear study notes, quizzes,
or flashcards using generative AI. Deployed using Stream lit platform and on GitHub under the repository Lecture-Notes.
